# Org Manager

**Declarative organization management as code.**

Org Manager automates **project creation**, **access control**, and **governance**
across enterprise tools such as Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, SonarQube, Nexus,
Bamboo and Alfresco.

Designed to scale to **hundreds of projects** using conventions, defaults and
minimal configuration.

---

## Why Org Manager?

Managing projects and permissions manually does not scale.

Org Manager introduces:
- Desired-state configuration
- Idempotent reconciliation
- Auditability via Git
- Plan / Apply workflows
- Tool-agnostic governance

---

## Core Concepts

- **Desired State**: Configuration defines what *should exist*
- **Reconciliation**: The system aligns reality to the desired state
- **Convention over Configuration**: Defaults first, overrides only when needed
- **Access via Groups**: Users are managed indirectly through roles/groups
